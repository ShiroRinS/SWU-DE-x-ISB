# SWU DE x ISB Machine Learning Activity: Supervised Learning & Classification 🚀  

Welcome to the **ISB Machine Learning Activity!** This activity is designed to introduce you to **Supervised Learning**, specifically **Classification**, using **Machine Learning**. No prior experience is required—just follow the steps below!  

## 📌 What is Supervised Learning?  
Supervised Learning is a type of Machine Learning where the model learns from **labeled data**. That means we provide the correct answers during training, and the model learns to make predictions based on patterns in the data.  

## 📌 What is Classification?  
Classification is a type of Supervised Learning where we predict **categories** (e.g., "Benign" vs. "Malignant" in breast cancer detection). The goal is to teach the model to correctly classify new, unseen data.  

## 🔥 What Will You Do?  
1. Open the **Google Colab Notebook** (linked below).  
2. Follow the step-by-step guide to train a Machine Learning model on breast cancer data.  
3. Submit your results through the provided **submission form**.  
4. Compete with others to achieve the highest accuracy and recall! 🎯
### There will be two rewards:
1. 🏅 **Highest Recall & Accuracy**: The person who achieves the highest recall will win the first reward. In case of a tie in recall, accuracy will serve as the tiebreaker, followed by the model with the fewest features.
  
2. 🏅 **Fewest Features, High Accuracy & Recall**: The second reward will go to the person who uses the fewest possible features while maintaining high accuracy and recall.

Good luck and happy coding! 🏆
